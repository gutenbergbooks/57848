</div>
<p class='c006'>Under the immense increase which is now taking place in
the length of range and accuracy in effect of small arms,
there must, of necessity, come an increase of the importance
of skill in skirmishing. The reconnoissances of mounted
staff officers, the patrolling, skirmishing, and menacing of
charges by small bodies of cavalry, and even the action of
artillery on that very large proportion of the surface of the
earth in which vision is limited to at most one thousand
yards, will be greatly controlled by the accurate and distant
infantry marksman. Nay, even columns and lines
of infantry will now only be able to repel his power of
destructive annoyance by meeting him with troops in
extended order. Of old, if he pressed too near to a closed
body of infantry, an impatient volley might sweep him and
his comrades into annihilation, but now, ensconced in his
distant cover, he may “beard the lion in his den,” a battalion
of infantry in position, with something like impunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this distant power of the individual skirmisher,
however, there stand connected increased difficulties of
combination with his surrounding and supporting comrades.
Such general unity of action is most important at
times for reasonable security, and always for the production
of general and total effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>These advantages must depend, more than ever, upon
well-impressed individual acquaintance with the essential
principles of good skirmishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these considerations the following pages, which
were received at the time of their first publication with
public<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and private testimonials of approbation, are reprinted,
with some corrections and additions to make them
suitable to the present standard of military efficiency, and
with remarks which may be useful, at this period, upon
light infantry drill, rifle practice, dress, and appointments.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>February, 1852.</i></p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003' title='Preface to the First Edition'>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Some high continental military authorities have of late
years proclaimed that British soldiers are incapable, or
next to incapable, of acting as light infantry. Than this
announcement there never was a clearer illustration of the
golden maxim, “Assertions are not proofs.” If our censors
had taken the trouble to search for evidence, southern
and western Europe would have told them, that in these
portions of the civilized world there have not been known,
in the middle and modern ages, light troops superior to
those of Britain. In archers, the light infantry of “the
olden time,” by what nation in the world was England
surpassed? Her troops of this class, the direct forefathers
of a large proportion of our present soldiery, gained for
themselves a name that might, one would think, have
sounded even to the shores of the Baltic, which at least
has rung upon every ear familiar with the tales of Poictiers,
Cressy, and Agincourt. All of these, as described by
foreign pens,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> were won mainly by the skill and conduct
of the British bowmen. At Cressy 12,000 Genoese, then
the most renowned light troops of continental Europe,
were driven like chaff before unerring cloth-yard shafts
from the tough old English yew.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Had our critics inquired concerning more modern warfare,
their Hessian neighbours would have told them that
in the North American revolutionary contest, in that six
years’ war of surprises, skirmishes, and ambuscades, among
unequalled woods and wildernesses, the British soldier in
himself was more than a match for the skirmisher-bred
American woodsman; and, to say the least, as alert and
intelligent at the outposts as his well-trained German
fellow-combatants. The struggle, indeed, ended unsuccessfully
to Britain; but, let the blame rest where it may, it
cannot be thrown upon the British soldier; he never came
short of his duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the protracted and astonishing conquest of Hindoostan,
which had some European inimical spectators, the
flank companies of battalions did three-fourths of the
work; not only concentrated at the breach and escalade,
but also, when necessity required it, extended in the
jungle.</p>

<p class='c007'>And to come to those contests which offer the fairest
estimate of the British soldier as he now is, and with
which all civilized military critics may be expected to have
become acquainted, the European campaigns of the Duke
of Wellington; it is not sounding an empty boast, but a
note of most sober and honest truth to say, that, than the
British light troops of his army, better never guarded a
camp or fought in a skirmish. In a fluctuating war of
eight campaigns, over many hundred miles of varying
country, opposed to the bravest and most intelligent soldiers
of the continent, none were ever more constantly
conquerors in action or more successfully vigilant on
outpost duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true, indeed, that the British light infantry man
has a practical system in some important particulars
peculiar to himself; and in none more so than that,
under all circumstances, he continues the well-disciplined
soldier, never systematically assuming the character of the
loose, lawless, free-corps freebooter. From this last
peculiarity may have arisen the incorrect impressions of
our foreign contemporaries. We, however, glory in the
difference, and affirm that stern discipline and high soldier-like
principle must form the basis of thorough military
efficiency to the full as much in the light and extended
services, as in those of a more concentrated description.</p>

<p class='c007'>Free corps originate in long internal wars. Happily
for Britain, she of late has not been distinguished for such
nurseries of irregular military skill; but when her territories
were desolated by them, there were not wanting
bodies of this description as active, intelligent, and enterprising
as any that ever graced the continent of Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>To assist in keeping up the remembrance of the
essentials of the practical system of the modern British
light infantry man, in that important branch of his duty,
skirmishing; in order that foreigners, whatever be their
theories, may continue to receive, when necessity requires
it, practical evidence that British soldiers can act as light
infantry, is the principal object of the Author in submitting
to the army the following observations.</p>

<p class='c007'>1837.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chap1' class='c003' title='The Essentials of Good Skirmishing'>THE ESSENTIALS OF GOOD SKIRMISHING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Skirmishing is the art of fighting, with numbers insufficient
to occupy, in close order, the ground contested.</p>

<p class='c009'>In light infantry or skirmishing drill, as in all other
instruction, the principal art is, to dwell <i>forcibly</i> on things
<i>really  essential</i>; <i>moderately</i> on things <i>merely important</i>;
and <i>lightly</i> on things <i>nearly indifferent</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>To good skirmishing there are <i>eight essentials</i>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Active Intelligence.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Correct Firing.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. Daring Courage.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. Making the best of Cover.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. Presenting the smallest possible Marks to the
Enemy’s Fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>6. Maintaining Extension from, and Dependence
on, a given File of Direction.</p>

<p class='c011'>7. Preserving a sufficient Readiness to resist
Cavalry.</p>

<p class='c011'>8. A judicious Employment of Supports and
Reserves.</p>

<p class='c012'>Very deficient in any of these qualifications, skirmishers
cannot be of the first order. Possessing them all in
reasonable proficiency, <i>skirmishers must be very good, let
the character of their other attainments and systems of
drill be whatever it may</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>I.</h3>
<p class='c012'>The life and especial mark of the good skirmisher is
<span class='sc'>Active Intelligence</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the ranks, the closer men attain to a state of unreflecting
mechanism, with nothing of mind but attention,
the nearer they are to true soldier-like perfection. Not a
thought should arise, an eye-ball turn, or a finger tremble,
but in obedience, and that obedience should be accurate
and instantaneous as the word. Not so the skirmisher;
within certain limits he is his own general, and must think
for himself. From the moment that he “shakes out”
from the elbows of his right and left comrades, reflection
must awake, and, in due dependence on a broad established
system, be energetically directed to gain every advantage
on the opposing foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French as skirmishers excel in active intelligence.
Every man manœuvres as if the fate of the day depended
upon his conceptions. Their ability, in this particular,
may spring in a great degree from the looseness of their
instruction practice of all field exercise. This, while it is
ill calculated to make steady soldiers at close order, is well
adapted to give free scope to the natural intelligence of
skirmishers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mechanical stiffness, formerly much seen in British
light infantry, arose, there can scarcely be a question, from
the formality of our old ordinary mode of applying the
system of light infantry drill. The automatonism, proper
to the ranks, was extended to skirmishers, and they also
were taught to move only as they were wound up. The
indignation of the drill instructor was poured out, not
upon men who failed in the first-rate essentials of good
skirmishing, but upon those who erred a foot in dressing
or in distance—who did not step off, halt, or fire, precisely
at the sound of the whistle or elevation of the signal fire-lock—whose
unmusical ears refused to distinguish amid
the endless variety of bugled orders—who could not run
like racers, or who ran bewildered in some of the intricate
evolutions, which were supposed to crown the very pinnacle
of skirmishing perfection. Some corps did not drill
according to this erroneous method, others did not carry
it to its full extent; but, taking the army as a whole,
unreflecting precision in the details of skirmishing was its
system, and to this day that system has its votaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is no small proof of the strength of natural intelligence
in British soldiers, that, when brought into actual
service, they broke through the fettered stiffness of their
instruction drill, let go what was indifferent in it, clung to
that which was important, and soon rivalled their intelligent
and experienced opponents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true summit of perfection in skirmishing is, <i>the
preservation of order in disorder</i> and <i>of system in confusion</i>;
for the circumstances which accompany skirmishes of
necessity produce, almost always, more or less mixture,
inversion, and general irregularity. In hot contests over
large extents of intricate ground, men of different companies
regiments, brigades, and even divisions, mingle with each
other. Soldiers should therefore be drilled, <i>not indeed to
fall into such irregularities on principle, but to be ready for
them in practice</i>. They should be made at times to skirmish
in inverted companies, mixed companies, and mixed regiments—to
form good skirmishing lines out of confused
masses—to concentrate from similar mixed bodies into
squares to resist cavalry, or into lines or columns for the
purposes of charging or defending streets of villages, or
other defiles—to extend again rapidly, and to perform
every necessary evolution as if no mixture or irregularity
had occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Such movements, when inculcated as necessary exceptions
to good order, do not unfit soldiers for more regular
manœuvres; but, by the contrast, increase order and intelligence
in them.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Soldiers who have not been drilled on this principle, or
who have not acquired it by experience, are, when extended
under fire, continually liable to be transformed into unmanageable
mobs. Skirmishers who understand it, will
always show a formidable front, be ready for every changing
event, and, under the worst possible circumstances, act
together in the mighty energy of mutual confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unreflecting mechanical precision is at direct variance
with such practice, active intelligence and a wise well-defined
general system are its component elements. Active
intelligence, therefore, in every point of view, is invaluable
to the skirmisher; and the attention of all drill superintendents
and instructors should be unremittingly directed
to stamp it on his mind and to mix it with his practice.</p>
<h3 id='chap1ii' class='c013'>II.</h3>
<p class='c012'>The soldier at close order always has, or should have, a
large mark for his fire. Nothing can be more unsteady or
unsoldierlike than for a closed body to pour a volley upon
mere skirmishers: from troops concentrated, no object but
an opposing mass or line within 200 yards should provoke
a single shot.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The skirmisher has not this advantage, his
mark is generally small and often indistinct; besides which,
the temptation to careless aim is much greater to him, who
fires away sixty or one hundred and twenty rounds over
hedge and ditch without intermission, than to the battalion
soldier, who seldom expends more than twenty at any one
time. Hence the peculiar necessity for practising light
troops to cool steady aim and accurate firing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immense importance of very great attention to the
ball practice<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> of this branch of the service, is too obvious
to require an enforcing observation; but it ought to be impressively
remarked, that good practical aim is not to be
acquired <i>only</i> in front of the target, <i>but to the full as
much</i> in the every day drill firings, with or without blank
cartridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not the case that careful firing is provoked by the
sight of an enemy; on the contrary, arithmetical calculation
has repeatedly proved, to the blush of the good soldier,
that under no circumstances are balls so wildly and carelessly
thrown away as in those moments when the fortunes
of empires are thrown away along with them. In action,
the greater number of the musquets are pointed <i>generally</i>
at masses of dust and smoke, and not <i>precisely</i> at the dark
active figures which they envelop.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons, on the drill field, instead of the loose
careless practice too common in this particular, the soldier,
and especially the skirmisher, should be unsparingly compelled
to go through the motions of aiming and firing at a
precise object, as accurately as if at actual ball practice,
until the habit be engraven too deep on his mind to be
obliterated by any circumstances of confusion.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>III.</h3>
<p class='c012'>Daring courage, as an acknowledged essential to the
thorough soldier of every class, it would scarcely have been
necessary to have noticed in the present enumeration, did
not an opinion appear to obtain, much on the continent
and with some in Great Britain, that light troops are
required to exercise it in a less desperate degree than men
at close order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Foreigners, when extended, often spend systematically
much time in long shots and shy fighting, and give way, as
a matter of course, before troops in weightier formations.
In the British service this opinion does not prevail; there is
no good reason why it should, and it is of great importance
to the thorough efficiency of skirmishers that it should not.</p>

<p class='c007'>The British soldier is as much a grenadier at heart, with
a green tuft in his cap skirmishing through a wood, with
no close support but his tried and trusty rear-rank man, as
he is in designation, when mounting a breach, under a
black bear-skin, with ten thousand bayonets at his back.</p>

<p class='c007'>In extended order he is just as ready, as at any other
time, to fix his bayonet and dash to close quarters, if the
enemy, on tolerably equal terms, will stand for him; and
if his piquet be pressed by a heavy attacking column, he
sees no more reason than at any other time, to surrender an
inch of ground, as long as he can stand upon it. Very
remarkable instances of this kind occurred during the
Peninsular war.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is well that it should be so; for if it be indeed true, as
some insinuate, that the British soldier falls somewhat
below his continental brethren in the policy of skirmishing,
this important essential, <i>persevering unflinching courage</i>,
will ever, as it always has done, make up for minor deficiencies,
and carry him triumphantly through.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is useful to observe, how much the flinching practice
of foreign light infantry has influenced, and perhaps been
influenced by, their systems of drill. The old method,
which we borrowed from them, of firing advancing by alternate
ranks or files, may be practicable with long shots and
cautious movements, but is only partially applicable to the
service practice of British light infantry, who, even when
close to their enemy, count it most unsoldier-like to fire
without an immediately important purpose in view; who
seldom fire at all until within two hundred yards of their
object;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and who, after a few quiet shots to get within the
length of their breath and to draw on the enemy’s fire,
dash at the opposing line of defence with that peculiar rush
which may be called “the skirmishers’ charge.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The present established mode of advancing firing by “single
line,” is that into which daring skirmishers always do, and
of necessity always must, fall. On the drill ground, when
required, this mode may be completed to a perfect copy of
“the skirmishers’ charge,” by the sound “double quick” at
about eighty yards from the supposed enemy’s line of
defence. The whole then, still partially firing, dash on at
an accelerated pace, until, the cover gained, “the halt” is
sounded, to take breath behind it, and prepare for another
forward effort.</p>
<h3 id='chap1iv' class='c013'>IV.</h3>
<p class='c012'>Conduct which in some cases, under fire, is disgraceful, in
others is meritorious. The man in the ranks who shrinks
away from a shell or cannon ball, or who goes out of his
commanded course to cover himself from musquetry, has
little claim to the name of a <i>brave</i> soldier; while he who in
a trench or battery does not bow low at the cry “shot,” or
fall prostrate before a blazing shell, <i>or who in a skirmish
neglects to make the best of every foot of cover</i>, has no right,
to the title of a wise one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference arises from the line of military perfection
being struck, not according to what will suit or save the
individual, but by that which will benefit the general
service.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the duties peculiar to compact fighting and
skirmishing, the distinction should be drawn broad and
deep on the drill field; because on the battle field, it is
natural on either side to be forgetful.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are two kinds of cover—<i>ball proof</i> cover, and
<i>mere concealing</i> cover. Ragged rocks, large trees, brick
and stone walls and buildings, stout fences and thick mud-banks,
constitute generally the first class; young plantations,
gorse and underwood, hedges, abattis, slight fences
and narrow sand hills, the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is for the first that the eye of the good skirmisher
continually seeks. The second, after fire completely opens,
turned even to best advantage, <i>is worth but little more than
no cover at all</i>; and is worse than no cover at all, if the
men, which they are much disposed to do, collect in groups
behind it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this way, that very frequent out-lying piquet defence,
abattis across roads, is often more injurious to friends than
to foes. Instead of being planted, as an obstacle to the
enemy, 100 yards in front of the intended line of defence,
it is but too commonly placed <i>on</i> that line, and when the
struggle comes, is thickly occupied as a sort of rampart.
On such striking objects the enemy’s fire concentrates,
every ball goes through, and the loss behind is severe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Skirmishers must not only seek for cover, but <i>make the
best of it</i>. Good cover loses half its advantages if stupidly
occupied, and ingenuity will often make bad cover ball-proof.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, notwithstanding all that may be said in favour
of “making the best of cover,” it must be thoroughly
remembered, that this duty, at the moment of a close
attack, is altogether secondary to those of courage and
activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it comes to short distances, the quicker the affair
is settled the less will be the loss of the assailants; and
the more daring the front exhibited, the greater the
probabilities of success.</p>

<p class='c009'>At every change of situation supports should, if possible,
be placed under cover by their commanders; if exposed,
as large bodies they form most inviting marks to the
enemy’s long shots. This precaution, when opportunities
offer, should not be forgotten on the drill field.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c013'>V.</h3>
<p class='c012'>One man at 200 yards<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a> is a very small mark. Two
abreast together, a tolerably good one; three abreast
together should almost always be hit, and four never be
missed. Our opponents, therefore, in skirmishing, cannot
serve us better than by grouping together; and that
which we would wish them to do, we ourselves must
carefully avoid. Skirmishers should move in single files,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
except in thick “concealing cover,” when two or three
together may, without exposure, increase mutual confidence;
or behind patches of “ball-proof cover,” on which small
groups may concentrate as to temporary breast-works; in
either case extending again at once when good cover ceases.
Even in single files, men loading should incessantly cover
with precision their file leaders, so as to offer marks of but
one in front.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>In skirmishing,  more than in any other branch of
warfare, men may be uselessly thrown away</i>; and therefore
in this, more than in any other, economy of life and
limb should form a paramount object of attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>On British soldiers also, perhaps more than on any others,
it is important to impress these observances; for there is
in them such a peculiarly strong national perception of
that great military maxim, “concentration is strength,”
that overlooking its exceptions, they are always powerfully
impelled the hotter the fire to group the closer together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing but deeply impressed instruction, or dearly
bought experience, can break in them the bonds of a propensity
so thoroughly at variance with good skirmishing.</p>
<h3 id='chap1vi' class='c013'>VI.</h3>
<p class='c012'>In all systems of movement composed of many distinct
bodies, there must be a common centre of direction, connexion
and extension, or unity of purpose and effect must
cease, and confusion, dispersion or concentration ensue.
Such a centre there is in the minutely regular mighty
moving system of the universe; and from it, down through
every degree of importance, to that in the more mob-like
progress of a swarm of bees.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Perhaps the greatest defect in modern skirmishing is,
that, in extensive affairs, this principle of an established
point of direction is not well maintained.</i> However much
it may be recognised in mere theory, it is not, in instruction,
explained in sufficient fulness, or required with
sufficient rigour; and from these neglects arise, in a great
degree, the inversions, mixtures, and other irregularities
in actual service before noticed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is most injudicious to encumber the minds of men
and officers with a multitude of intricate or non-essential
recollections; but the principle in point involves nothing
of this character; it is at the same time very simple and
highly essential.</p>

<p class='c009'>For all skirmishers of the same battalion acting
together, until they become thoroughly mixed with other
corps—in all cases of movement, excepting only those of
changes of front on the principle of the wheel on the fixed
pivot, and those of taking ground to a flank obliquely or
directly; <i>the centre, or right centre file<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> of their own
battalion skirmishers is</i> <span class='fss'>THE POINT OF DIRECTION</span>, <i>unless at
the time</i> <span class='fss'>OTHERWISE ESPECIALLY ORDERED</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>When detachments from several battalions skirmish
together, the battalion of direction for the line in rear, is
that of direction for the skirmishers in front, unless <i>at the
time</i> otherwise ordered. If no such battalion has been
pointed out, the officer commanding the extended line
names to the officers in command of detachments the
battalion skirmishers of direction, and takes care to keep
these last to their true course and object.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every officer in command of the skirmishers of a
battalion has the option, in responsible dependence on
the maintenance of the general alignement and proper
communication, of changing his point of direction, <i>by
order at and for the time being</i>, to the flank file nearest
to the battalion skirmishers of direction, or otherwise as
circumstances may appear to require.</p>

<p class='c009'>In all changes of front on the principle of the wheel on
a fixed pivot, that pivot is, of necessity, <i>during the evolution</i>,
the file of direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>In taking ground to a flank obliquely or directly, the leading
file always becomes, during this movement, <i>and no longer,
unless especially ordered at the time</i>, the file of direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>When skirmishers become mixed and unmanageable,
and there is neither time nor opportunity for re-forming
them at close order on their covering serjeants, the officer
in command fixes upon <i>any man</i> as a point of direction,
the others instantly extend away right and left (unless at
the time especially ordered to extend to either flank in
particular), without regard to their original proper places—double
into files—take up the general alignment—officers
and non-commissioned officers with alertness take
charge of proper portions, and the whole move and act
upon this new centre, as if no inversion or mixture had
occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon such simple rules, well impressed and strictly
maintained, any number of skirmishers may fight over
large extents of the most intricate ground, perfectly in
hand and without confusion. Or, should extraordinary
events produce irregularity, officers in command may
easily, in an instant, under the worst circumstances, restore
good fighting order, until leisure permits a more regular
formation.</p>

<p class='c009'>In extensive skirmishes, the eyes and feelings of men
retiring are powerfully drawn towards the most apparently
important points of defence; and upon these, without
direct orders, they more or less concentrate. Assailants
follow the same impulse, and direct their force principally
against these identical strongly occupied points.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hence follow of necessity on both sides a massing into
large marks for the fire of opposing musquetry, sometimes
even of artillery—great unnecessary bloodshed in violent
struggles, and a neglect on the defensive side of ground
which ought to be occupied, and on the assailing side of
points which ought to be attacked. Nothing but keeping
men in hand by the principle of well understood and
well maintained centres of direction can prevent similar
evils.</p>

<p class='c009'>Supports, in their movements, should be guided by the
same general principle as skirmishers—that is, the centre
or right centre support of each battalion should be, unless
otherwise ordered, the support of direction, except in the
cases of wheeling on a fixed pivot, or of taking ground to
a flank. In the first exception, all conform to the pivot,
and in the last to the leading division, <i>unless at the time
otherwise ordered</i>. Supports, not belonging to the battalion
of direction, except in the two cases just noticed, conform
under the orders of their senior officer to the movements of
those which do belong to it, with due regard to their
primary duty—<i>the proper support of their own skirmishers</i>.</p>
<h3 id='chap1vii' class='c013'>VII.</h3>
<p class='c012'>Skirmishers, by the looseness of their formation, are
dangerously exposed to charges from small parties of the
enemy’s light cavalry; and in districts destitute of continuous
fences, but abounding in hollows, isolated patches
of wood, or other features convenient for concealment, such
attacks may burst forth with most confusing suddenness.
Except in ground absolutely impracticable for cavalry,
skirmishers must move in constant expectation of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eye of the officer should be accustomed to recognise
habitually those frequently occurring posts of defence
against cavalry, copses, walls, hedges, ditches, &amp;c., which
are preferable to small squares; and the minds of men
should be well prepared by previous instruction <i>and
explanation</i>, to recollect, in an instant, in what their
strength in such cases consists, and to be undaunted in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Against great charges of cavalry, large squares are
unquestionably the safest and most efficient; but, in
opposition to the small dashes which occur in skirmishing,
large squares are often impracticable, and small ones
more advisable, as being more rapidly formed and broken
up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Squares have a moral strength in proportion to the
mutual acquaintance of the men and officers who compose
them. Men of the same company stand better together
than those of mixed companies, and men of the same
regiment better than those of different corps. However,
as in the field thorough mixtures do occur, and as they, if
observed, are likely above all other things to bring on
charges from the enemy’s cavalry, squares of mixed masses
should, in instruction, at times be practised.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not necessary to describe the different modes by
which, on the drill field, men may be thrown into confusion.
When this state of things has been brought about,
mixed, irregular, rallying squares can be formed by adding
the “double quick” to the ordinary sounds for squares
against cavalry.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The “double quick” is required to mark the necessity
for instantaneous irregular masses, in contradistinction to
the more regular squares, <i>which on the drill field skirmishers
should always endeavour to form, unless at the time otherwise
ordered</i>. It cannot be too constantly upheld as a
permanent principle that, even in skirmishing, <i>order is the
rule and irregularity the exception</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the signal “double quick” in immediate succession
to the sounds established for the formation of squares,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
officers, exercising most actively their intelligence, in proper
numbers and at proper distances, hold up their swords or
caps, and the men rush round them into masses of
defence without any regard to company or other distinctions.</p>

<p class='c007'>These mixed squares, as well as all others, may “commence
firing”—“cease firing”—“advance”—“retire”—“take
ground to a flank,”—or “close” to any particular
square, by order, or by the simple sounds for these movements.
The “close” may be important to form a large
square from several small ones, the cavalry still hovering
near.</p>

<p class='c007'>To these mixed squares also, the word or sound to
“extend” may be given. The men then, without regard
to regular places, extend away to the right and left from
each square, and double into files.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ground is nearly occupied, the officer in command
fixes on a point of direction, to which the whole
conform.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the event of infantry skirmishers pressing forward to
harass a square, or of cavalry endeavouring to prevent its
movements by hovering near without charging, one or two
ranks from the rear face may, by order, move briskly round
by the right and left—double into files—cover the front at
a short distance, and rush round again to their places
whenever there appears a necessity for the square itself
to fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>In drill in general, and in that of light infantry in particular,
instructors confine themselves by far too closely to
mere formal directions, to the neglect of pithy practical
explanations. In nothing is this last addition more
required than in reference to charges of cavalry.</p>

<p class='c007'>A column of horsemen, coming rapidly on with all its
denseness, its height, its dust, its shouts, and its clangour,
appears to the untrained mind as altogether irresistible.
But appearances are not in themselves realities—let cavalry
to the utmost stretch of mortal might,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come as the winds come when forests are rended;”</div>
      <div class='line'>And “come as the waves come when navies are stranded;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>one thing only will be required to enable squares of infantry,
like deep-rooted rocks, to disperse these wild winds
and waves, right and left, in dust, froth, and confusion—<i>a
well impressed knowledge of their own strength</i>; accompanied
as a natural consequence, by a deliberate employment of
that, <i>when properly used</i>, most destructive weapon, the
musket.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Nor can more blame attach to cavalry for such
results, than would apply to infantry for failing, in clear
day-light, before well-barricadoed buildings or well-scarped
redoubts. Neither in similar cases owe success, when they
get it, to their own conduct or efficiency, but to the needless
panic of their enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such conclusions as to the relative strength of cavalry,
are established by a string of facts more or less evident,
stretching from Ilium, through Pharsalia, to Waterloo;
and every fact is worth a thousand opposing ingenious
speculations.</p>
<h3 id='chap1viii' class='c013'>VIII.</h3>
<p class='c012'>Contending without a reserve is desperate risk in
struggles of all kinds, civil and military. In such predicaments,
if fortune frown, well nigh all is lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>In skirmishes, reserves, including in the first place supports,
are not only of great importance as rallying points,
in extraordinary cases of misfortune, but also as necessary
aids to the ordinary movements of the extended line.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>attacks</i>, supports are useful for filling up accidental
gaps in the front line—for prolonging its flanks or covering
them obliquely or perpendicularly—for strengthening the
skirmishers at any moment that these may find their numbers
unequal to important work before them—for relieving
them when they or their ammunition become exhausted—for
coming up in close order to charge bridges, streets,
villages, or other defiles, too strongly occupied to be forced
by the skirmishers, and to serve as bases, when time allows
it, for the formation of squares against cavalry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>defences</i>, in addition to the foregoing duties reversed
as to bodies retiring, supports have the highly important
responsibilities of leading the skirmishers in the true and
best line of retreat—of opening that line in all suitable
places for their convenient passage, and of taking care that
it be not intercepted by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reserves, particularly so called, supply the places of supports
when necessary, and go to the front for any object
requiring the intervention of a particularly strong, steady,
and concentrated force.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without express orders, supports should not move forward
to occupy accidental gaps in the extended line, except
on ground so intricate, or under circumstances so emergent,
that the skirmishers themselves cannot readily regain their
lost communications.</p>

<p class='c009'>In most movements, set unvarying sentences of command
promote alertness and prevent mistakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>For prolonging in the same direction the flanks of the
extended line—for covering them perpendicularly or obliquely—for
strengthening the skirmishers by mixing others
with them, or for relieving them; the following set, concise
orders to supports obviously present themselves:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. —— Support.</span>: <span class='sc'>Prolong the —— Flank.</span><br />
In the same direction as the general line understood.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Do. —— Do.</span>: <span class='sc'>Cover the —— Flank</span>,<br />
<i>perpendicularly</i>; with moderate licence,
according to the features of the ground,
understood.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Do. —— Do.</span>: <span class='sc'>Cover obliquely the —— Flank.</span><br />
<i>An obliquity of one-eighth of the circle</i>,
with the same licence, understood.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Do. —— Do.</span>: <span class='sc'>Strengthen No. ——.</span><br />
To prevent mistakes, the word “strengthen”
to be repeated with sufficient distinctness
by the officers and non-commissioned
officers of the Support to which it
is given, when they arrive near to the
skirmishers or the skirmishers near to
them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Do. —— Do.</span>: <span class='sc'>Relieve No. ——.</span><br />
The word “relieve” to be repeated in like
manner, for the same reason.</p>

<p class='c012'>With regard to strengthening the extended line by mixing
its supports with it, it may be objected that, in such
cases, when there are no reserves at hand, the great rule of
never fighting without them is rejected. It is true, the rule
is violated; the party if actually engaged is fighting at a
desperate risk, but there are cases in which desperate risks
are wise and lawful ventures. These are in the not uncommon
events with skirmishers of desperate extremities; at
such moments methodical prudence is ill-masked imbecility.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 10th of December, 1813, some of the piquets of
the light division, in thick weather and a close country, were
suddenly assailed by the heads of heavy columns. The
division in the rear was scattered in straggling houses. One
of the companies on piquet was forced back upon another
in support, near the point of junction of two important
roads leading directly into the cantonments. Both companies
were instantly extended, without any support, into
a thick skirmishing line; nothing less would have been
effectual. The ground was held with little variation for at
least two hours—two heavy attacks were repulsed, every
round of ammunition was expended, the brigade immediately
in the rear allowed to pack and send off its baggage,
and steadily to take up its fighting position, and the piquets
to fall back upon it without further molestation. Similar
circumstances have no doubt occurred, and may often occur
again. The great maxim alluded to therefore has its exceptions,
<i>and these, if carefully marked as exceptions</i>, may
<i>sometimes</i> with propriety be admitted into instruction
skirmishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>To attack or defend, with concentrated supports, a bridge,
the street of a village, or other peculiarly important point,
the word is simply passed, “Supports, close on No. ——,”
the support in front of, or on, that point. Near this division
of formation the officer in command places himself;
and as each severally arrives gives his direction—“line,”
“double column,” “open,” “close,” “quarter distance,”
“half distance column,” or otherwise, as may be thought
necessary. The support of formation in all cases standing
fast as the basis.</p>

<p class='c007'>To break up the formation, “Supports to your proper
places, threes right and left shoulders forward, quick
march,” will speedily restore all to common skirmishing
order.</p>

<p class='c009'>No duties of supports are more important than those in
retrograde movements, of leading their skirmishers in
proper lines of retreat; and of opening those lines sufficiently,
but not more than sufficiently, for their passage.
Circumstances have actually occurred, and, in intricate
countries, are likely often to be repeated, of fine fellows,
slowly retiring before an overwhelming enemy, their whole
attention absorbed upon their front, suddenly finding further
retreat intercepted by impassable obstacles, with no
alternative remaining but to surrender, or fight their
way right and left at the risk of almost utter destruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principles advanced in the foregoing remarks, are
not, in the main, of a character to be limited to the details
of particular movements; but are rather to be kept continually
on the mind, for the purpose of being thrown into
effect as circumstances may require. <i>Practical</i> differs from
<i>formal</i> skirmishing, even more by the style than by the
method of its execution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not one sentence, it is believed, will be found to stand
in opposition to the British established system. The few
points in which they may at first sight appear to differ from
it, consist simply in an application of principles already
established to a practical extent somewhat beyond that
usually adopted. If an officer who did not act upon this
extent of application, were to succeed in the command of a
corps to one who had adopted it, neither he nor those under
him would experience any difficulty from the previous
practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should not be forgotten, that the thorough spirit of
practical skirmishing is not to be communicated or maintained,
with only one or two companies at a time, on the
level, restricted, drill field. Soldiers, after having been
<i>thoroughly</i> grounded in elementary details and permanent
principles, should be often taken out <i>in large bodies</i> to
skirmish, <i>with strict, universal and incessant attention to
the duty</i>, across extensive and intricate tracts of country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such tracts are often to be found without restrictions in
foreign stations; and at proper seasons of the year, a little
management and promises of repairing damages will generally
procure access to admirable skirmishing ground from
British farmers and landed proprietors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer is conscious that he can have advanced little,
if anything, that must not have occurred to officers who
have had experience in this branch of warfare, or that may
not have been brought into instruction practice by them.
He has not, however, seen the foregoing practical application
of essential principles thrown <i>broadly</i> into print; and
it appears to him important that it should be so exhibited,
in order that the spirit of actual skirmishing may not be
confined to the regimental locality, or cease with the regimental
employment of those who witnessed it.</p>

<p class='c012'>1. The company or division of <i>about</i> sixty men, is the
<i>unit</i> of extended Light Infantry, in the same manner as
the battalion of about six hundred men, is the <i>unit</i> of a
large military force at close order. Every company, or portion

of uncertainty in circumstances of rapidity.)</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Extensions are in single files six paces apart, and
firings are carried on by alternate ranks, front rank commencing.
The front rank and rear rank man must never
be unloaded together.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>When not firing.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>5. All movements are in “quick time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>7. All movements of skirmishers are at the
“double quick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>8. Skirmishers while halting, on open ground
drop on the right knee; on intersected
ground they make the best of any
cover near them, choosing their own
bodily position.</p>

<p class='c011'> 9. In advancing, men whose rifles are loaded
always pass by the <i>right</i> of those who
are loading; and in like manner in
retiring, men who are not loaded pass
to <i>the proper left</i> of those who are
nearly ready to fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>10. In advancing, <i>all</i> load “as front rank,”
rifles on the left side, muzzles to the
front; in retiring <i>all</i> load “as rear
rank,” rifles on the right side, muzzles
to the rear.</p>

<p class='c012'>11. In all movements directly to the front or rear, the
right centre file of the company skirmishers, is the proper
<i>file of direction</i>, to whose course all others conform, and
from towards which they keep their relative distances.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. In all movements directly or obliquely to a flank,
the leading file of that flank is, <i>for the time being</i>, the file
of direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. In all changes of front on a fixed pivot, the file
which is that pivot is, of necessity, <i>for the time being</i>, the
file of direction. (See on this most important particular
of “the file of direction,” <a href='#chap1vi'>Article VI.</a> of “The Essentials.”)</p>

<p class='c007'>14. Troops skirmishing at a greater distance than three
hundred yards from the line or column, should retain one
half of their number in support. (See on this subject
<a href='#chap1viii'>Article VIII.</a> of “The Essentials.”)</p>

<p class='c007'>15. Skirmishers ordered to “form square,” close upon
their supports.</p>

<p class='c007'>16. If the bugle be employed, the less of it the better,
provided the order be distinct to all concerned in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>17. The <i>last</i> note of a bugle order marks the moment
for the <i>commencement</i> of obedience to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>18. All verbal orders and bugle commands not understood
by the skirmishers, should be repeated in a low but
distinct tone by officers and non-commissioned officers in
charge of sections.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Almost all of these</i> “<span class='fss'>ORDINARY RULES</span>” <i>may be altered,
at the time, for extraordinary</i> and <i>temporary purposes</i>.
As for instance: No. 1, portions of different companies
may be placed by superior orders under one commander,
to control them as if they were of one company. Nos. 2
and 3, <i>extension</i>, may be ordered “from the right,” “left,”
or any particular file, and <i>closing</i>, in like manner. No. 4,
“double files,” may be ordered for mutual protection in
going through thick cover; or, “single rank,” under heavy
fire in open ground, and the distance between the files may
be contracted or enlarged, in order to occupy less or more
ground. Nos. 5 and 6, skirmishers, not firing, may be
ordered to “double quick,” to “kneel,” or to “lie down.”
Nos. 7 and 8, skirmishers, firing, to “common quick” or
to “stand up.” No. 10, the file of direction may be
changed to any other file that may for the time being suit
the purpose of the commander. No. 11, skirmishers running
towards their supports to form squares, may suddenly be
arrested by the order “rallying squares,” for instantaneous
irregular formations, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such measures being (it is
repeated as very important) the <i>temporary exceptions</i>, and
the “ordinary rules” the <i>standing practice</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Careful consideration has been given in regard to the
“ordinary rule” No. 7, that, <i>under fire</i>, all movements
of skirmishers should be at the “double quick,” inasmuch
as it is at variance with the practice hitherto pursued in
the British army, of saving the soldier as much as possible
from efforts of extraordinary exertion. The author’s careful
proof of the long range rifle, on the low water smooth
sands of an extensive sea beach, in which the final course
of every bullet was marked, added to the great amount
of other testimony on the same subject, have convinced
him, that, for the future, within the range of eight hundred
yards, <i>all</i> movements under the fire of a well posted enemy
<i>must</i> be at the “double quick,” to avoid ruinous destruction.
If the distance required cannot be surmounted in
one effort at such speed, it must be traversed by successive
dashes to intervening cover.</p>

retires at the “double quick” to thirty paces in rear of
the rank that is loading, and so on successively; with the
simple difference of principle from firing advancing, that,
whereas, while advances under accurate fire from long
ranges cannot be too rapid, with due regard to the preservation
of physical strength and correct firing, retreats cannot
be too slow and dogged, with due regard to the danger of
being pressed <i>too</i> closely by the enemy. <i>Fifty</i> paces of

from the centre; each file turning full to the front as it
gains its distance. The left subdivision has now become

<p class='c007'>Any body of infantry on the march in line may “extend”
from any named file on the principle just described; and,
on the same principle, skirmishers on the march may
“close,” by bringing up the shoulder so as to join successively

centre file of the skirmishers, the remaining files of the support
bring forward their shoulders right or left so as to open
out successively to their proper distances from the centre as
skirmishers, turning again full to the front when these are
attained. On reaching the line of the former skirmishers
these last-mentioned receive the order,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<i>Right subdivision</i>,” “<i>retire</i>,” “<i>to the centre, close</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The centre file of the new support proceeds straight to
the rear, rear rank leading, the other files close upon the
centre successively; the support is halted at its proper distance,
the new skirmishers having, in the meantime, taken
up the position and employment in all things of those
relieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the skirmishers are <i>advancing</i> when the order to
“relieve” is given, they receive the word “halt,” and allowing
the new line of skirmishers to pass through them to a
sufficient distance to the front, close to the centre, and follow
on in support.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the skirmishers are <i>retiring</i> when the order to
“relieve” is given, the support “halts,” “fronts,” and
“extends” upon its own line. Continuing the “retreat”
so soon as the new support, having closed, has attained its
proper distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>If “commence firing” has been given before the order to
“relieve,” the relief takes place upon the principles just
above described, with these additions—that if relieved at
the <i>halt</i>, the old skirmishers spring up as the new
skirmishers are reaching them and “double quick” to the
rear one hundred paces before they begin to close—if in
<i>advancing</i>, the new skirmishers “double quick” one
hundred paces from the rear, and the same distance to the
front of the old line, the latter lying down, and not rising
or closing until the relief has opened its fire; and if, in
<i>retiring</i>, the old support lies down so soon as it is extended,
and allows the former skirmishers to pass through it at the
“double quick” (continued for one hundred yards) before
it springs upon the knee and opens its fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The important object of the running and lying down in
relieving under fire of course being, that the new and old

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Advanced and Rear Guards.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>An advanced guard, on a road on the line of march,
consists of <i>a large reserve</i>, <i>a small reserve</i>, <i>a support</i> and
<i>skirmishers</i>. The <i>first</i> of these, according to the “Field
Exercise of the Army,” may be <i>one subdivision</i>, about five
hundred yards in advance of the head of the main column;
the <i>second, a complete section</i>, two hundred yards further on;
and the <i>third</i>, one hundred yards more in advance, <i>the
remaining section</i> of the company, throwing out one hundred
yards again to its front a double file of skirmishers on the
road, and a double file (if the strength of the section admits
of so many) obliquely to each flank.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is of course of the highest importance that this
formation, in the whole of its progress, (maintained frequently
through a long day’s march, in thick weather, and
through intricate roads,) should be preserved in perfect
unity by links of ocular connexion. No one portion of
it should ever be, for many minutes at least, unseen by
some other portion. For this reason, the distances of
separation must vary with the hour of the day, the nature
of the country, and the state of the weather, and one or
two files of communication should remain midway between
the several detachments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ordinary mode of forming an advanced guard of
course is, for the body composing it to proceed along the
intended road, dropping its different portions and files of
communication as they successively attain their relative

  <h2 id='chap3' class='c003' title='A Method of Instruction for the Speedy Acquirement of Proficiency'>A METHOD OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE SPEEDY ACQUIREMENT OF PROFICIENCY IN THE USE OF THE LONG RANGE RIFLE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i>The recruit or pupil must</i> <span class='fss'>FIRST</span> <i>have his intelligence
distinctly informed, and his memory strongly impressed,
with what the Rifle can be made to do at any given distance</i>.
He will thus be prepared for instruction, <span class='fss'>SECONDLY</span>, in the
art of making it do what it can do.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>first</i> particular may perhaps be accomplished to full
satisfaction by the following method. The trials that now
induce the proposal of it,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a> were, with the regulation
musquet, very satisfactory. The various degrees of the
power of the weapon were, to the extent the experiment
was carried, accurately ascertained and distinctly exhibited.</p>

<p class='c007'>A piece of level ground must be set apart for rifle
practice. The length, with the present power of range,
should be from 1400 to 1500 yards. Forty feet would be
sufficient for the width, excepting at the permanent butt,
where, for security’s sake, it should be at least forty yards.
It would be very desirable that no boundary straight walls
or fences should guide the eye to the target. At the permanent
butt, a racket court wall should be built, from
thirty to forty feet high, and from thirty to forty yards
wide, with side-wings, to stop glancing shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten yards in front of this centre should stand a wooden
target, painted white if the wall be painted black, or <i>vice
versâ</i>; with a “bull’s-eye” at four and a half feet from the
ground—this target being divided into square feet by lines,
easily distinguishable through a small telescope from the
furthest extremity of the range.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this wooden target, as a commencement, the
practice ground should be marked off into lengths of fifty
yards each. At each of these fifty-yard stations, two
sockets should be sunk into the ground, to hold, when
required, the <i>outer frame</i> of an intermediate target.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>inner frame</i> should hang by hinges on the outer, so
as to open and shut as a door.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be covered with the most yielding material
(paper or otherwise), that would stand with an ordinary
wind, so as to offer the least possible resistance to a passing
bullet.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be painted with a “bull’s-eye” and lines,
corresponding <i>precisely</i> with those of the wooden target.
The wooden target station should be provided with a ball-proof
sentry-box for the marker, on wheels; and each of
the intermediate stations with a like ball-proof sentry-box,
a long wooden shed, with a locker in it for the paper
target, and a very solid and steady rest on wheels, with a
groove at the top for the steady firing from it of the rifle,
at the same height from the ground as the “bull’s-eye” in
the targets.</p>

<p class='c007'>To prevent accidents, four or five bells should be hung
on pillars at intervals on the side of the line of practice,
with short flag-staffs above them, for the hoisting of
signals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The size of the paper targets should be calculated to
include the widest ordinary variations of the bullets.
Three feet might be sufficient for the furthest from the
butt, the width gradually increasing to twelve feet, at the
nearest station to the wooden target. The height must
rise and fall, as far as it might be practicable, with the line
of the ordinary highest flight of the bullet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifty yards have been given as the proper interval
between the paper targets, because that distance suited the
round ball and regulation musquet. The very elongated
parabola of the course of the conical bullet may admit of
that course being sufficiently shown in paper targets one
hundred yards apart.</p>

<p class='c007'>It did not appear, in the experiments made, that the
resistance of the paper had any effect of consequence on
the flight of the ball. This of course would depend much
upon the texture of the covering material. In calm
weather, a little water sprinkled on the paper targets
would really make resistance nominal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing preparations being completed, and the
instructor having, by means of them, made himself well
acquainted with the powers of his rifle—<i>that</i> rifle, moreover,
being of the kind which his recruits or pupils are to
bring with them—the squad takes post at the longest
effectual range station,—we will say, for the ordinary
infantry rifle, at eight hundred yards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paper targets are left open, and the wooden target
with its “bull’s eye,” seen. The wooden rest is placed in
the centre, and a rifle laid steadily in it, at the elevation
given by the instructor as necessary for hitting the distant
“bull’s eye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To prevent accidents, this rifle is not cocked. At a signal
given the paper targets are shut, beginning with the nearest
to the butt, the recruits being made to remark, as they are
successively closed, that the “Bulls’ eyes” are in a perfect
line. The nearest bell is rung; two minutes are allowed
for persons on the line to run into the ball-proof sentry-boxes,
and the shot is steadily fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distance and elevation of the rifle being carefully
entered in the firing-book, which every pupil should possess,
the squad proceeds to trace, by the paper targets, the course
of the ball to its ultimate destination. At every target,
the height or depression of the shot in inches from the
central line of the “bull’s eye,” is carefully observed, and
noted down—the point blank distance is especially entered.
The shot-holes, in the meantime, are covered with the
smallest possible patches of fresh paper, or, in the wooden
target, plugged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squad then returns to the next nearest, or seven
hundred yards’ station, repeats the same process of levelling
a rifle at the elevation ordered by the instructor, and of
tracing and noting down the course of the ball; and so on,
diminishing each time a hundred yards, and at last to fifty
from the target.</p>

<p class='c007'>By a systematic course of this kind, for which four hours,
or half a day, would be sufficient, about twelve men might
attain a <i>permanent ocular</i> knowledge of the power of their
rifles on level ground at every possible range. It would,
of course, be necessary that the rifles and charges should
be uniform in size, weight, and quality. The effect of
strong side winds upon the bullet (which is considerable)
might also sometimes be shown, and rifles accurately proved
one against another.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very possible to make a rest in which the discharge
will only occasion a <i>direct</i> recoil, and it would therefore
seem that, with due attention, this mode of proof, and this
instruction in what the rifle will do, might be carried very
near to perfection.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>The next step is to make the soldier do for himself what
he has seen his rifle, if properly managed, will do.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>For this purpose, the paper targets and frames must be
cleared away and stowed in the lockers, the rests wheeled
off the line, and half the squad (six men) assembled, rifles
not loaded, at the fifty yards from the wooden target station.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first man is placed in the line of the “bull’s eye,”
the rest of the squad lodging their arms in a rack under
the shed, and returning to watch the practice attentively.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man to fire, having loaded very carefully, is asked by
the instructor—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Q.</i> What is your distance from the mark?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>A.</i> ... yards.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Q.</i> What must be the elevation, or depression?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>A.</i> ... inches above, or below, the bull’s eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>If he should forget, or be incorrect, he is not to be set
right by the instructor, but made to refer to his own firing-book
for information. Of course, if the rifle be provided
with carefully-proved sights, he should be taught to make
use of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He is then warned to bring up the rifle quietly from the
hip, looking, while he does so, at the point he wishes to hit,
to shut the left eye close, and to look with the right eye
through the sights themselves, and not over or beneath them,
to pull the trigger steadily the moment the object is accurately
covered, at this instant throwing his attention to the
care of keeping the line of barrel direct to the mark until
the bullet has left the muzzle—perhaps the most difficult
attainment in ball practice, and that which constitutes the
greatest difference between a good shot and a bad one.</p>

<p class='c007'>These principles being clearly communicated, the nearest
bell is rung, a minute’s delay given for short distances, and
two minutes for long ones, and the shot is fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marker instantly steps out of his ball-proof box, with
a light pole, having at its extremity a bright scarlet circle,
which he lays upon the shot-hole in the wooden target—the
number of inches above or below, and right or left, of the
centre of the “bull’s eye” is entered in the firing book—the
man falls back to the squad, and the next for firing
takes his place.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a man hit very wide of the proper mark, it might be
well to make him fire until he had attained a reasonably
good shot, charging to his account the surplus ammunition
so expended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squad would then fall back to one hundred yards
from the wooden target with a repetition of the same practice,
then to two hundred, and so on to the longest range.
Not more, probably, than three stations could be got
through in a day, by any one squad, with advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of each day’s work, a careful return of the
details of firing should be sent by the instructor to the
commanding officer, in conformity with which, rewards,
commendations, and censures, might be finally distributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The details of proceeding have been somewhat minutely
described, because this elementary instruction, to form a
solid and effectual basis for subsequent general practice,
should be a minutely patient and careful work. In order,
also, to prevent the serious accidents which want of system
might occasion, especially at the long ranges, it would be
important to establish and maintain minute uniformity of
proceeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a course as that above recommended would only
occupy four days, and it would make a man for all his life,
if he had the talent to profit by it, a good marksman, with
rifles of the same power as that which he had thus carefully
proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>This elementary instruction would not, of course, set
aside more free and desultory practice at other times, provided
it were carried on with obedience to the general regulations
for security against accidents.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is almost superfluous to observe, that the instructors
provided with the “stadia,” and with small telescopes
headed with simple “micrometers,” should point out to
officers and men the readiest methods of calculating distances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking twenty-five as the average number of pupils that
could be, with full advantage, under daily practice, and four
days as the period for completing their instruction, one
hundred and fifty might be thus finished in the twenty-four
(as an average) working days of each month, a battalion of
about six hundred men in four months, and consequently
twelve hundred men in the eight temperate months (from,
about the 1st of March to the 1st of November) in each
year.</p>

<p class='c007'>To complete, therefore, the British army on home service
in one year, there would be required about forty such establishments
scattered throughout the United Kingdom, and
for the volunteer rifle corps and militia about fifty more.
After the year of theoretical instruction, they would
remain as most useful for freer practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The expense would be, the cost of the land, which (considering
that strips of worthless soil, or of government
ground, might in many instances be procured gratis)
should not exceed five hundred pounds the station; and
light fencing, the butt, targets, sheds, ball-proof sentry-boxes,
rests, and a small house for the marker in charge of
the ground, which might average four hundred pounds
more. In all nine hundred pounds for each establishment
as a permanent outlay, or about thirty-six thousand pounds
for the regular army, and forty-five thousand pounds for
the volunteer rifle corps and militia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The markers might be military pensioners, with a small
addition to their pay, and the instructors retired officers or
non-commissioned officers, with a similar allowance. Many
from these classes would be well calculated for such duties,
and would enter with spirit into them.</p>

<p class='c007'>To give complete success to an appeal to the nation for
the expenditure thus required, notorious facts, added to a
widely-acknowledged principle, mentioned in the first
edition of this treatise, should be sufficient: “Every
<i>reasonable outlay</i> towards the maintenance of national military
efficiency <i>is true economy</i>; and <i>the neglect of it, real
extravagance</i>.”—(“Essentials,” Art. 2nd, Correct Firing.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The notorious facts referred to are, that the marvellous
inventive spirit of the age has, at one bound, made military
efficiency dependent, in a <i>super-eminent degree, on skill in
rifle practice</i>, and that other nations, sensitively alive to the
circumstance, are devoting to it immense methodical attention.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chap4' class='c003' title='Short Observations on Dress and Appointments'>SHORT OBSERVATIONS UPON DRESS AND APPOINTMENTS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It is so distinctly evident that the immense advance which
is at the present period in operation upon military weapons
and practice must extend its influence to dress and appointments,
that a treatise of this kind would not now be complete
in its parts without a reference to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dress will be affected pre-eminently, in a manner which
has not, as yet, attracted much, if any, public attention. It
will be indescribably more than ever important to distinguish
the troops of one nation from those of other nations,
by uniforms that can be known afar off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the most perplexing, hindering, and revolting
incidents of a campaign, are those of mistaking foes for
friends and friends for foes. Facts are the best arguments;
and a few of those which occurred under the author’s own
observation, in a corps probably as little liable to make
mistakes as any that ever stood on a battle-field, are offered
in enforcement of this consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the retreat from Madrid, in the grey of the morning,
after having been harassed through the greater part of
the day before by impudent dashes of the French light
cavalry, a Spanish cavalry patrol was fired upon, under the
very natural impression that they were Frenchmen, re-commencing
their previous practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this, while engaged in the pursuit of a beaten
enemy through a mountainous and intricate country, the
battalion was compelled, as a matter of reasonable prudence,
to scale a rocky hill, in order to take up a position of
defence against three battalions in blue, which had just
appeared as if moving to intercept the line of retreat.
When a quarter of an hour had been wasted, they also
turned out to be Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c007'>On a subsequent occasion, in following up a charge in
line, from the thick smoke that still hung on the enemy’s
infantry a body of horsemen, of which some evidently were
cuirassiers, broke furiously upon the front. It had all the
appearance of an effort of the French cavalry to cover the
retreat, and the whole fire was for a moment concentrated
upon it, until some of the headmost horsemen, falling
almost upon the bayonets, were perceived to be English
light dragoons.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are a few, and only a very few, of the evils which
have already arisen from indistinctness in uniform. If,
then, the mischief was so great in connexion with the
limited and uncertain power of the old musquet, what will
it not be with the distant and accurate fire of the long
range rifle? A group of your own staff officers, a patrol of
your own cavalry, or a battalion in blue of your own
infantry, eight hundred yards off, might be almost destroyed
before it could be possible to correct the mistake; while
bodies of the enemy might, from your uncertainty, pass and
repass with corresponding impunity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Whatever uniforms, therefore, we adopt or maintain, it
is evident that, for cavalry as well as infantry, broad</i>
<span class='fss'>NATIONAL DISTINCTIVENESS</span> <i>should be a most predominant
consideration</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another immense advantage in distinctive uniforms
for troops who can and will do their duty—the
mighty moral effect which such distinctiveness carries with
it. Like the mere</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Blast of Roderic’s bugle horn,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>it “is worth” in itself, in a stout struggle, the support of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A thousand men.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Many a time has the distinctive red coat sounded a
retreat to the enemy, which he would have been slow to
adopt if any doubt had existed about the real character of
the troops he had fallen in with.</p>

<p class='c007'>Popular error ought to be corrected in regard to colours
suitable for light infantry, by the plain matter of fact, that
skirmishing is not in general a prowling, wolf-like proceeding,
but sheer hard and open fighting; in which, indeed,
the parties engaged make the best of any cover that
presents itself, but in which also the flashes and smoke of
firing alone present marks for reply that no tint of uniform
can conceal. In concealing-cover, not the coat, but the
head dress and face are seen. It is a reasonable subject of
doubt whether on open ground, at a distance of six hundred
or eight hundred yards, red, soiled by dust, dirt and
drenching, does not mellow into a greyish-purple, as little
calculated to make the man who wears it a mark as blue,
black, or dark green. Take away white epaulettes, white
lace, and white belts, and the red jacket itself may still
continue to be, with prudence and propriety, the leading
star on land of England’s high honour and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The increased rapidity with which, to prevent ruinous
destruction, troops of all kinds, when under fire, must now
move for considerable distances, gives increased importance
to the very plain principle, that the efficiency of a locomotive
weapon of war is, in the highest degree, dependent upon
the proportion of its weight to the strength of the animal
that carries it. Weight of metal is of immense moment on
a rampart; but lightness of heart and litheness of limb,
producing sustained and easy movement and careful firing,
are advantages of more importance to the soldier in the
field.</p>

<p class='c007'>These principles embrace his appointments as well as
his weapons; and it may be possible, now that public
attention is called to the subject, to extend their application,
dependent as this is upon the public purse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weight of the ammunition and bayonet has hitherto,
in regard to the infantry in general, been supported upon
the shoulders, and that of the former concentrated on one
point. It would appear very possible to divide the support
between the shoulders and the waist, and to distribute it
equally around. The thirty inches of space which, in
general, surround the waist of the full-grown man, would
allow of sixty ball-cartridges, placed side by side perpendicularly
in four flat well-made pouches, one on each side
before, and the same behind. These might be attached to
a waist-belt clasping in front, and supported, moreover, by
a few stout buttons in the coat, and by a pair of very light
belts, in the general form of common braces, crossing on
the back, but in front falling straight down from the
shoulder without crossing, and terminating each in two
points. The material for all these belts might he leather,
and the colour, that very common tint reddish-brown, to
assimilate with the coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantage of this arrangement would be, that, in
addition to the weight being equalized, the soldier could,
as he pleased, ease his shoulders by tightening the waist-belt,
or ease the waist by loosing the clasp. He would be
also free to throw wide open the coatee in oppressive
weather, or in falling out on the line of march. Than this
last, there could not perhaps be a greater relief to the
practical soldier.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a campaign, a man might conveniently carry, in
addition to this ammunition, thirty rounds of gunpowder
in a stout well-made flask, slung by a red strap over the
shoulder, and a bag with thirty bullets, in greased patches,
on the right side of his waist-belt, to balance the sword-bayonet,
suspended from a frog on the left side. For long
ranges, loading from the powder-flask might be safe and
convenient—the cartridges would serve for closer quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The present almost iron neck-band might be exchanged
for the simple, neat, and durable patent Albert spring-wire
stock, covered with soft leather. Possibly, also, the soldier’s
house, which he carries on his back—and which, in a
campaign, must be for weeks together his only shelter—his
great coat, or cloak and blanket, might be made lighter by
substituting superior materials. In no other way can the
weight of the knapsack be much reduced.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is certainly of immense importance to the safety and
prosperity of the nation that all the foregoing subjects
should be, <i>even now</i>, appreciated with practical closeness.
Other civilized states are most active in investigation and
in application. <span class='sc'>The British soldier stands cheerfully
ready and willing to do his duty to the country—it
is for England to do her duty to herself and to
the soldier.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>From this designation the author would by no means
exclude any portions of the armed land-defenders of the
British empire, so far as they might have claim to it by
character and attainments. Let the volunteer rifle corps
and militia acquire and maintain (as did the county
militias during the last great war, and as have done many
of the yeomanry corps since that period) that drill and
discipline without which, in the hour of danger, men-at-arms
are jests to their enemies and pests to their friends,
and they also may with justice be classed among the soldier-like
guardians of their country.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this branch of instruction, there is unquestionably a very wide
field for practicable improvement. In addition to some advances nearer
to perfection in the construction of the musquet itself, <i>very much</i> might
be done towards the art of using it, in the ways of systematical scientific
instruction, and improved local conveniences for ball practice. These of
necessity would entail some public expense, but every reasonable outlay
towards the maintenance of national military efficiency is true economy,
and the neglect of it real extravagance.—(<i>First edition.</i>)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The characteristic difference between British and foreign ideas of
good light infantry is quietly portrayed at a stroke by Napier, when, in
answer to St. Cyr’s remark, that “the Migueletes are the best light
troops in the world,” he observes, “If, instead of <i>fifteen thousand</i>
Migueletes, the <i>four thousand</i> men composing Wellington’s light
division had been on the heights of Cardadeu, <i>General St. Cyr’s
sixty rounds of ammunition would scarcely have carried him to Barcelona</i>,”—<i>Peninsular

<i>the general practice</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This file should be calculated by the flanks and centres of divisions,

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If this were true in the days of the musket, how much more must
it now apply to cavalry charges made for one thousand yards under

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
